# Snyk-Code-Analysis
This project examines the power of Snyk when integrated in Visual Studio for code scan and easy manual analysis.

This panel shows all the open source and third party security scan result.
Thye below screenshot helps the DevSecOp Engineer see a clear deropdown of the issues with Opensource codes and depencies that has been commited to the project.

Beyoung just seeing the list, it helps me the details of the code, gives me a chance the do a detailed analysisw to the engineering team of what exactly is wrong with the code.

Snyk does a great job of helping me with links and resources to do a deepdive on the vulnerability, its implications on my project, how easily exploitable and the vast reasource that could be in the wild for even script kiddies to leverage.


This pannel is a go to when working with an engeering team that would like every detail to be pointed out to be sure I have done my own home work.

On several cases I would see some suggestions on how previous engineers fixed thye vunerabilty.

This ia another strong point in presenting my facts to either the team lead, security leadership or engineering team.

Snyk has a powerful CLI capability to show all the scan results in the CLI with a link to the vulnerability in Snyk Vuln Database. 

From the CLI, I can set Snyk to closely monitor the Project for future vulnerabilities. 
This capabilityn is a highly critical feature. 

Code that was not vulnerable yesterday could become vulnerable when you commit new codes to the project and Synk is able to monitor new issiues that arise in the project.

The vulnerabilities are colored according the their severity. This helps me easy pickout the critical ones that needs attention the most.

Here you can access the project in a very user friendly UI in Snyk Dashboard.

Here I have the CVE number and many details that would help me future research and even perform threat hunting.
